Introduction To Growler
=======================

Growler is a micro web-framework which is designed to help you create an asynchronous
website or webservice with minimal effort.
It brings together many design choices of other successful web frameworks from various
languages into an asyncio-compatible python library.


Goals
-----

* Provide a minimal framework for writing (potentially) complex, asynchonous code
* Have no dependencies outside standard python libraries
* Pure-python, so any complete implementation of modern python should run a growler application
